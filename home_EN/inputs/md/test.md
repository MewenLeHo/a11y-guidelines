## How to test digital accessibility&nbsp;?

Orange evaluates the accessibility of an application, a site or any other digital resource using three complementary methods&nbsp;:
- ** Technical evaluation **&nbsp;: inspect the code and color contrast to measure WCAG compliance for the Web and best practices for other technology platforms.
Part of the tests can be done automatically by tools but the majority requires manual control.

- ** Functional evaluation **&nbsp;: test the interface behavior with different assistive devices to verify that the evaluated content is free of blocking points.
The tests are essentially performed for 3 behaviors: the use of a screen reader, a software magnifier and keyboard navigation.

- ** User evaluation **&nbsp;: the application is tested by disabled users in order to check the accessibility level from their point of view.
These tests consist of making some target users whose position (or mobile ...) is equipped with a particular technical help (digital screen magnifier, screen reader, keyboard only, Braille display) the main tasks of the application. They make it possible to identify the problems of use and to validate the criticality of the anomalies encountered. These tests are conducted by accessibility experts.
